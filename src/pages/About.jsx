      <p>
        I’ve tried everything from ice hockey to ukulele. I’m passionate about
        learning, building, and occasionally falling off a skateboard. I love
        solving problems, even if I caused them. I live in Seattle with my
        family and a cat that thinks it's smarter than me.
